# Prisma 2 tutorial

⚠️ **This tutorial is outdated as of release [`preview020`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/releases/tag/2.0.0-preview020)**. With this release, Photon.js has been renamed to Prisma Client JS and Lift's migration functionality has been moved behind an `--experimental` flag.

The tutorial will be updated soon, in the meantime you can check out the updated [examples](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/) to learn what the changes `preview020` look like or follow the [Getting Started](./getting-started/README.md) guide.
