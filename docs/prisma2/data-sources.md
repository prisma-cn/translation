# Data source

A data source can be any resource or service that you can data read from or write data to programmatically.

A few examples are:

- Databases
- GraphQL APIs
- REST APIs
- 3rd-party APIs (e.g. the Stripe API)

You can also implement your own connectors for data sources. More info on that will follow soon.
