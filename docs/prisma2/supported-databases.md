# Supported Databases

Prisma 2 currently supports the following databases:

| Database   | Version | Status                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| MySQL      | 5.7     | **Official** support     |
| MySQL      | 8       | **Experimental** support |
| PostgreSQL | 10.X    | **Official** support     |
| SQLite     | 3.28.0  | **Official** support     |

When a database version is **officially** supported, it means that there is an internal test suite that's running against this version. **Experimental** support means that there are currently no internal tests against that database version. In most cases, this means that using this database version is still absolutely fine.

Note that a fixed version of SQLite is shipped with every Prisma 2 release.
